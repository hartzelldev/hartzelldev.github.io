# About Gary

I’ve been working with technology for most of my life. My earliest experiments were text adventure games on a Commodore 64, long before I knew what a career in IT or cybersecurity would look like. That early curiosity never really faded — it just evolved as the industry did.

Professionally, I earned my Associate Degree in Information Technology in 2002 and began working in IT the following year. Over the past two decades, I’ve built deep experience across both Windows and Linux systems

In 2008, I moved into cybersecurity, where I’ve spent most of my career. I’ve served as a security team lead for many of those years, working hands‑on with incident response, hardening, risk management, and the real‑world challenges that come with protecting systems and people. That background shapes how I think about technology — especially AI.

## Why AI (and Why AI Security)

I’m not the kind of developer who claims to be a master coder. What I *am* is someone who understands systems, risk, and behavior — and that’s exactly why AI captured my interest.

I enjoy building AI‑powered tools and games, and I’m a big believer in “vibe coding” as a creative workflow. But I also know that vibe coding only works when you have a strong technical foundation and a security mindset. The hype says anyone can do it; experience says otherwise.

My long‑term focus is AI Security: understanding how AI systems behave, how they fail, and how to build and secure them responsibly. Even when my projects aren’t directly tied to AI Security, they reflect the same curiosity and caution that drive my work in the field.
