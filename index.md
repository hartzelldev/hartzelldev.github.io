# Gary M. Hartzell
### AI & Cybersecurity Professional • Python Developer • Open‑Source Creator

Welcome to my development portfolio. I build open‑source Python applications that explore AI‑powered workflows, creative tooling, and simulation systems. My background spans 20 years in IT and 15 years in cybersecurity, and I’m currently focused on the intersection of AI and security — how these systems behave, how they fail, and how to build them responsibly.

Below are my active projects, each with a brief overview and the latest release status.
